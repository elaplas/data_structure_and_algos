# Problem 1
## Decisions
The algo starts incrementing the guess of the root value by multiplying with "2". If the square of guess is close enough to the target value, then it is incremented by one not to miss the precise value root of the target. 
 
## Time efficiency
- Average and best case: O(logn)
- Worse case: O(n)
## Space efficiency
O(1)
