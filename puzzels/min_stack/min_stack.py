# Design a Data Structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), 
# isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return minimum element from 
# the SpecialStack. All these operations of SpecialStack must have a time and space complexity of O(1). 


# Idea: The node of stack cloud store the value, next and the min seen so far
