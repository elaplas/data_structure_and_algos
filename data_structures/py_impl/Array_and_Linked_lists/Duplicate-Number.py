# ### Problem Statement
# 
# You have been given an array of `length = n`. The array contains integers from `0` to `n - 2`. Each number in the array is present exactly once except for one number which is present twice. Find and return this duplicate number present in the array
# 
# **Example:**
# * `arr = [0, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 3]`
# * `output = 3` (because `3` is present twice)
# 
# The expected time complexity for this problem is `O(n)` and the expected space-complexity is `O(1)`.

def duplicate_number(arr):
    """
    :param - array containing numbers in the range [0, len(arr) - 2]
    return - the number that is duplicate in the arr
    """
    sum_nums = 0
    for num in arr:
        sum_nums += num
    
    expected_sum = int((len(arr)-2) * ((len(arr)-2)+1) / 2)
    return sum_nums - expected_sum

# Solution
'''
Notice carefully that
1. All the elements of the array are always non-negative
2. If array length = n, then elements would start from 0 to (n-2), i.e. Natural numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5...(n-2)
3. There is only SINGLE element which is present twice.

Therefore let's find the sum of all elements (current_sum) of the original array, and
find the sum of first (n-2) Natural numbers (expected_sum).

Trick: 
The second occurance of a particular number (say `x`) is actually occupying the space 
that would have been utilized by the number (n-1). This leads to: 
current_sum  = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .... + (n-2) + x
expected_sum = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + .... + (n-2)
current_sum - expected_sum = x 
Tada!!! :)
